At the end of tools/build there are some
adjustments to make the analysis easier.

This survey was posted on the subreddits
/r/linuxactionshow, /r/linux, /r/linuxdev
and /r/sysadmin. Additionally, there was
only 399 submissions. So keep in mind that
the answers can be rather biased and that
the number of submissions are way too few
to be certain of any drawn conclusions.

• ... and do not know what they are talking
• The systemd-haters are just old people
• ... who hate change
• It is relevant whether systemd breaks the UNIX philosophy
• BSD users are butthurt about not being able to run systemd
• The media is creating the systemd-controversy

Facts:
• systemd is bad for servers (or at least server administrators think)



:: Correlation notes

There are correlations almost everywhere,
but these are the strong correlations.

A surprisingly large amount of people claim to be both system administrator and developers.

A whopping 36,(36) % of those that claim not to have graduated high school
claim to have completed high school or an higher education than that.
(However, that would only be four submissions.)
