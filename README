It appears the most people are taking this
survey very unseriously, so I will have
stopped analysing the data. But if you have
something to add please send a patch or
pull request or e-mail me.


At the end of tools/build there are some
adjustments to make the analysis easier.


This survey was posted on the subreddits
/r/linuxactionshow, /r/linux, /r/linuxdev
and /r/sysadmin. Additionally, there was
only 399 submissions. So keep in mind that
the answers can be rather biased and that
the number of submissions are way too few
to be certain of any drawn conclusions.


Run `make`, this will create the files
`data/correlations-ordered.html` and
`data/correlations-sorted.html` with
shows the correlations between then
questions.

You should really take a look at those,
they are very insightful.


You can use the command `./correlate`
if you want to find your own correlations.
`./correlate` will list all questions.
`./correlate 1 2 3` will correlate questions
question 1 against question 2 and than against
questions 3. The answers will be sorted by
how common they are. A question index can be
suffixed with ^ to reverse the order, ~ suffix
to get the average or the + suffix to only include
submissions where the answer is the same as in
the previous questions in command line. Additionally
you can add the = suffix to filter answers.
For example `./correlate 1="Against::In favour"`
will only include the 'Against' and 'In favour'
answers to questions 1. You can also cluster option:
`./correlate 27="Yes::Yes, encrypted:Yes::No"`.



:: Conclusion

Again, take a look at `data/correlations-ordered.html`.

By looking at how some topics rank and I conclude that
Group A are geeks and Group B are nerds. For example,
new-and-shiny is obviously a geek thing. This can also
be strengthened by looking at what known geeks and known
nerds think. (I know some think this is silly, but I
personally have never given a rats ass about the geek–nerd
topic. So I really don't care, but it seems to be a strong
correlation between that and most questions. And geeks and
nerds are really different from each other so I don't see
how it is silly.) But if you have some other theory you can
tell me and I will include it.

:: Observations

• A third are against systemd (conclusion explains why)

• 28 % think systemd breaks the UNIX philosophy,
  28 % think systemd is not breaking the UNIX philosophy,
  33 % think systemd breaks the UNIX philosophy a bit

• 37 % think systemd is monolithic,
  37 % think systemd is not monolithic

• 24 % have been frustrated by bugs in systemd,
  26 % if only counting those that have tried systemd

• 10 % are against smartphones, of which 34 % are against
  mobil phones, however only 68 % are in favour if smartphones

• 50 % of those that are attending university with a long
  education are for free software and 38 % are for open source,
  this is the only education-group where free software is
  more popular, apart from the those that are becoming docents
  where none (of the 6 submitters) are for open source

• 16 % are in favour of Gopher, only 22 % are against it

• Tiling and dynamic window managers are just (slightly more)
  popular as stacking window managers

• Wayland and Mir: 72 %
  ‣ Wayland: 96 %
  ‣ Mir: 4 %
  X and other: 19 %
  ‣ X: 81 %
  ‣ other: 19 %
  neither: 9 %

• 13 % like distributions for beginners



:: Correlation notes

There are correlations almost everywhere,
but these are the strong correlations.

A surprisingly large amount of people claim to be both system administrator and developers.

A whopping 36,(36) % of those that claim not to have graduated high school
claim to have completed high school or an higher education than that.
(However, that would only be four submissions.)
